Datomic Tools
=============

Datomic-tools is a thin wrapper on Datomic, optimized with a declarative api for working with Peers, Queries, and Schemas.

## Usage

Leiningen dependency:

    [facjure/datomic-tools "0.1.1"]

[Environ](https://github.com/weavejester/environ) is used to manage environment variables for AWS, Heroku, Cassandra and other storage engines.

Add the follwing keys in `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

    :datomic-dbtype (:free)
    :datomic-dbname ("test")
    :datomic-jdbc-url (postgres/heroku url)

## API

For in-memory datomic, setup:

```clojure

    (db/create-anonymous)
```

Create a schema:

```clojure

    (schema/create
      [[:story/title "full title" :string :one :fulltext :index]
       [:story/url "story's permamnent url" :string :one :unique-identity :index]
       [:story/slug "a short title" :string :one]
       [:comments "a collection of comments" :ref :many :component]
       [:comment/body "comment 140 chars or less" :string :one]
       [:comment/author "comment author" :ref :one]])
```

Validate:

```clojure

    (schema/has-attribute? :story/title)
```

Facts:


```clojure

    (fact/add
     {:story/title "Datomic's 1.0 is released"
      :story/url "http://datomic.com/downloads/1.0"
      :story/slug "New, improved declarative api"
      :comment/author 17592186045425
      :comment/body "This is great!"})

```

Finders:


```clojure

    (query/find-all-by :story/title)

    (query/find-changes 17592186045425)
    >> {:author/name {:old nil, :new "Stu G"}, :author/email {:old nil, :new "stu@somemail.com"}}

    (query/find-all-by :story/title)

    ...

```

Queries:


```clojure

    (query/defquery '{:find [?title ?url]
                      :in   [$ ?title]
                      :where [[?a :story/title ?title]
                              [?t :story/url ?url]]
                      :values ["Clojure 2.0 announced", "http://clojure.org/downloads/2.0-beta"]})


```

## Credits

A big thanks to Craig Andera's excellent tutorials, [Day of Datomic](https://github.com/Datomic/day-of-datomic). I learned a lot from studying the source code of the following libraries (and copied some functions): [mBrainz-sample](https://github.com/Datomic/mbrainz-sample), [Datomico](https://github.com/cldwalker/datomico), [Demonic](https://github.com/zololabs/demonic), [Lib-noir](https://github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir) (Validations)
